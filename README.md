Josh's Neural Nets project thing
================================

So I worked on this for awhile, and it does function, but I'm bored with it.

I'm putting it up so that in the future, someone can do something with it.

I'll be glad to take pull requests, etc. I'd also love to answer any questions, but some of those may be answered in this readme.


About the project
-----------------

This project is based around evolutionary Neural Nets.

It can support looping nets, but the way it runs nets will need to be changed to stop once there is an output available, or something.

Nets can be mutated in place, which I think is really neat.

Use `buildnrun.sh` to build and run the project. It doesn't do anything complicated.

Other than that, I'd really recommend just diving in!
